Hi!

This is my log for the Update 1.1. I still consider the initial version 1.0 even if it was more a beta than anything.

Things added:

-Credits: Now this has proper Credits.

-Rework of the entire code: Now the calculation for Leap Year is done properly and not taken from the txt. Also now this is separated in modules, uses Classes, import stuff from Python.

-Spell check: I fixed some typo mistakes.

-Installation guide in Readme: Not only how to install Python but how to execute the program without an IDE for people that don't know / don't like coding.
The game still looks better on an IDE, because CLIs like CMD or Powershell don't have UTF-8 support so things like "Kaomojis"; stuff like -> (┬┬﹏┬┬) can't be processed.

-Proper commands: This is an adventure game, but on the previous version you couldn't do any action. Now most actions are listed and some are Hidden. Lots of Easter Eggs.
As a downside now the game is 20% more Shitposty.

-"Random" events: I really wanted to add something that "spice" things up, to add some sort of interest in replayability.

-"Login" rewards: Why does a text adventure game needs this? Anyway, depending on the day of the week you get a different Item and a different color on the text.
