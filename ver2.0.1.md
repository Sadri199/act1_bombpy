# Dev Notes 2.0.1 Update

Hi!

This is my log for the Update 2.0.1. This is just a small patch to add more features and also a small glimpse into what else i can expand this project.

## Things added:

- Executable for the game **ONLY FOR WINDOWS**. Thank you PyInstaller for making this really cool Module, you can check more information about them here "https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/".

## To add:

- Simple GUI, yeah, i'm tired of seeing a CLI and i bet you reading would also like at least a minimalistic Window.
- Some fixes on the code itself, it's too Spaghetti code right now, i know some stuff can be really optimized, maybe dissect bomb.py into smaller files, change how some functions behave.
- More Actions, more Easter Eggs, more Endings. I receive feedback on a new idea for the magic cube and i want to implement it.

## Future Releases:

- I'm learning Django and i really want to transform this into a Web App, so you don't have to download tons of files just to make this work. I still have a lot to learn before i can even think about making this into a Web App but it's what will eventually come.
