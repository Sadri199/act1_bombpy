#####################General Information#####################

Hi!

This is my first "Project" in Python. I'm learning the language and decided to do something fun to test what i can do with it.
This is a Text Adventure Game.

For now this version is terminal only, but im planning to make updates from time to time.

This entire thing was done in Python 3.12.5, it should work in older versions but i haven't tested it. 

#####################General Information#####################

#####################How to Execute#####################

Installation -> 
Just install Python after downloading it from "https://www.python.org/downloads/", then double click "exec.py" to run the game on CMD or Powershell if you are on Windows. 
If you are inside the Terminal, you need to type "python exec.py" and hit Enter.

If you are on IOS or Unix, i don't know because i don't use those OSs yet. Sorry.

Windows 10 onwards, newer Terminal version that Supports UTF-8, it's still a beta but for the sake of this game it can be used!!!

This game was designed in an IDE called "Visual Studio Code", because it tolerates UTF-8, most stuff will look better on an IDE; stuff like -> (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳ will not look good in CMD or Powershell normal versions because it cannot process those characters.
If you want the "full experience", please install an IDE. If you want VSC you can get it for free from "https://code.visualstudio.com/download" and choosing the package that matches your OS.

######################Dev Notes 2.0 Update######################

Hi!

This is my log for the Update 2.0. I still consider the initial version 1.0 even if it was more a beta than anything.

Things added:

-Credits: Now this has proper Credits.

-Rework of the entire code: Now the calculation for Leap Year is done properly and not taken from the txt. Also now this is separated in modules, uses Classes, import stuff from Python.

-Spell check: I fixed some typo mistakes.

-Installation guide in Readme: Not only how to install Python but how to execute the program without an IDE for people that don't know / don't like coding.
The game still looks better on an IDE, because CLIs like CMD or Powershell don't have UTF-8 support so things like "Kaomojis"; stuff like -> (┬┬﹏┬┬) can't be processed.

-Proper commands: This is an adventure game, but on the previous version you couldn't do any action. Now most actions are listed and some are Hidden. Lots of Easter Eggs.
As a downside now the game is 20% more Shitposty.

-"Random" events: I really wanted to add something that "spice" things up, to add some sort of interest in replayability.

-"Login" rewards: Why does a text adventure game needs this? Anyway, depending on the day of the week you get a different Item and a different color on the text.
