# General Information

Hi!

This is my first **"Project"** in Python. I'm learning the language and decided to do something fun to test what i can do with it.
This is a Text Adventure Game.

For now this version is terminal only, but im planning to make updates from time to time.

This entire thing was done in Python 3.12.5, it should work in older versions but i haven't tested it. 


## Installation

So this entire project was done in a language called "Python", if you don't have it installed, you can get it for free from **"https://www.python.org/downloads/"**, just select the version that matches your OS, download it and install it like any other program.

Now you only need to either clone this repository (if you know how to use Git) or download it directly.
If you don't know how to use Git no problem at all, you can get it from this button!

This game was designed for a CLI that supports UTF-8; i made the entire thing in an IDE called __"Visual Studio Code"__, the reason to this is that i add some characters; stuff like -> (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳ and they require UTF-8 for it's display. They will not look good in CMD or Powershell normal versions because those cannot process this type of characters; they will look like this.

If you want the __"full experience"__, tou can choose either:

- To install an IDE, like VSC. If you want VSC you can get it for free from **"https://code.visualstudio.com/download"** and choose the package that matches your OS.
- Or if you are in Windows 10 onwards, there is a newer Terminal version that Supports UTF-8, it's still a beta but for the sake of this game it can be used!!! You can get it from here **"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab&hl=en-us&gl=US"** Thank you Bill Gates!!!!

Here, you can either:

- Double click __"exec.py"__ to run the game on CMD or Powershell if you are on Windows.
- Or if you are inside a Terminal, you need to go into the folder of this Project, type __"python exec.py"__ and hit Enter.
- If you are in an IDE like VSC you need to open a terminal inside that program and type __"python exec.py"__.
- If you are on IOS or Unix, i don't know because i don't use those OSs yet. Sorry.
