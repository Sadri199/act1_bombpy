Hi!

#####################General Information#####################

This is my first "Project" in Python. I'm learning the language and decided to do something fun to test what i can do with it.
This is a Text Adventure Game.

For now this version is terminal only, but im planning to make updates from time to time.

This entire thing was done in Python 3.12.5, it should work in older versions but i haven't tested it.

#####################How to Execute#####################

Installation -> 
Just install Python after downloading it from "https://www.python.org/downloads/", then double click "exec.py" to run the game on CMD or Powershell if you are on Windows. If you are on IOS or Unix, i don't know because i don't use those OSs yet. Sorry.

This game was designed in an IDE called "Visual Studio Code", because it tolerates UTF-8, most stuff will look better on an IDE; stuff like -> (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳ will not look good in CMD or Powershell because it cannot process those characters.
If you want the "full experience", please install an IDE. If you want VSC you can get it for free from "https://code.visualstudio.com/download" and choosing the package that matches your OS.
