Hi!

This is my first "program" in Python. I'm learning the language and decided to do something fun to test what i can do with it.
This is a "Text Adventure Game".

This entire thing works in Python 3.X, just open terminal and type "python bomb.py" to execute it. 

This first version is terminal only, but im planning to expand it more in the near future.

Enjoy!
