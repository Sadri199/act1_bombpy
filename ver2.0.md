# Dev Notes 2.0 Update

Hi!

This is my log for the Update 2.0. I still consider the initial version 1.0 even if it was more a beta than anything.

Things added:

- Credits: Now this has proper Credits.
- Rework of the entire code: Now the calculation for Leap Year is done properly and not taken from the txt. Also now this is separated in modules, uses Classes, import stuff from Python.
- Spell check: I fixed some typo mistakes.
- Installation guide in Readme: Not only a **how to install** Python but also a **how to execute the program**, even without an IDE for people that don't know / don't like coding.
- Proper commands: This is an adventure game, but on the previous version you couldn't do any action. Now most actions are listed and some are Hidden. Lots of Easter Eggs.
As a downside now the game is 20% more Shitposty.
- "Login" rewards: Why does a text adventure game needs this? Anyway, depending on the day of the week you get a different Item and a different color on the text.
- 10 Different Endings, wow!
